Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a given class based on input variables.


Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems where the outcome is either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. Instead of fitting a regression line like in linear regression, we fit an "S" shaped logistic function, which predicts two maximum values (0 or 1).
The sigmoid function is a mathematical function used to map the predicted values to probabilities. It maps any real value into another value within a range of 0 and 1. The S-form curve is called the Sigmoid function or the logistic function.

## Types of Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression can be classified into three types based on the categories:
- Binomial: There can be only two possible types of the dependent variables, such as 0 or 1, Pass or Fail, etc.
- Multinomial: There can be 3 or more possible unordered types of the dependent variable, such as "cat", "dogs", or "sheep".
- Ordinal: There can be 3 or more possible ordered types of dependent variables, such as "low", "Medium", or "High".

The assumptions of logistic regression include:
- Independent observations: Each observation is independent of the other.
- Binary dependent variables: The dependent variable must be binary or dichotomous.
- Linearity relationship between independent variables and log odds: The relationship between the independent variables and the log odds of the dependent variable should be linear.
- No outliers: There should be no outliers in the dataset.
- Large sample size: The sample size is sufficiently large.
